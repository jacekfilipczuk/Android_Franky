##About
Franky is a client-server application whose design has been carefully studied to be natively modular and resilient. The client side was designed to be simple, immediate and user-friendly. Users can connect to Franky database server and search opinions on a particular item, or add their own opnion and upload it to the database. For every item in the database, there is also an average rating made by users. The server side was developed in PhP and MySql and offers data persistency, consistency and performance.
